                <p>Tim Bergling, better known by his stage name Avicii was a Swedish DJ, remixer, record producer, musician, and songwriter who specialized in audio programming, remixing, and record producing. At the age of 16, Bergling began posting his
                    remixes on electronic music forums, which led to his first record deal. He rose to prominence in 2011 with his single "Levels". His debut studio album, True (2013), blended electronic music with elements of multiple genres and received
                    generally positive reviews. It peaked in the top ten in more than fifteen countries and topped international charts; the lead single, "Wake Me Up", topped most music markets in Europe and reached number four in the United States. In
                    2015, Bergling released his second studio album, Stories, and in 2017 he released an EP, Avīci (01). His catalog also included the singles "I Could Be the One" with Nicky Romero, "You Make Me", "X You", "Hey Brother", "Addicted to
                    You", "The Days" , "The Nights", "Waiting for Love", "Without You" and "Lonely Together". Bergling was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work on "Sunshine" with David Guetta in 2012 and "Levels" in 2013. Several music publications
                    credit Bergling as among the DJs who ushered electronic music into Top 40 radio in the early 2010s. Bergling retired from touring in 2016 due to health problems, having suffered from stress and poor mental health for several years.
                    On 20 April 2018, he committed suicide in Muscat, Oman. He was buried on 8 June at Hedvig Eleonora Church in his hometown. His posthumous third album, titled Tim, was released in 2019.</p>
